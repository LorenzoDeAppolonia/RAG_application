* TEXT SPLITTER:
    - Test the different chunk sizes --> test with: {chunksize = 1024, overlap 128}

    - Add system prompt /
    - Try double step query
    - Search the prompt syntax
    - Look for classes and methods

* METADATA:
    - Fix 'generate_metadata': add docstring, check the node relationships. (each node has .relationships which could be useful) /
    - Implement self query of the vectorstore
    - Implement index class /

* GENERAL:
    - Check time taken by queries. Invoke step takes a while.
